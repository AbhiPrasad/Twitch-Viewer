## Shoutouts

Thanks to [bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com) and [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv)

### Note:
If the functions seem like their repeated a lot, it was because trying to avoid asynchronous stuff. I made some adjustments to avoid using timers or Javascript promises, but if promises are implemented the code will be much cleaner and faster.
